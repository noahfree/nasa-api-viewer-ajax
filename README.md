# NASA API Viewer Using AJAX Requests
This is a website created for an assignment in one of my classes at Mizzou. It uses a NASA API &amp; AJAX requests to display content based on the Sol & Camera selected by the user. Please note that this webpage is not yet mobile-friendly; the purpose of the application is to demonstrate skills related to AJAX & using an API.
